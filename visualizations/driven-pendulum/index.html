            <h2>From Order to Chaos</h2>
            <p>
                The Driven Pendulum is a classic example of a physical system that can exhibit chaotic behavior. It's essentially a standard pendulum that is also subjected to a periodic, external driving force. The interplay between the natural swing of the pendulum, the damping (friction), and this external force can lead to a rich variety of motions, from simple periodic swings to complex, unpredictable patterns known as <strong>strange attractors</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="iframe-container">

            </div>

            <h2>The Equation of Motion</h2>
            <p>
                The behavior of the system is described by a second-order non-linear differential equation:
            </p>
            $$ \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \delta\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \sin(\theta) = F(t) $$
            <p>
                Here, \(\theta\) is the angle of the pendulum, \(\delta\) is the damping coefficient, and \(F(t)\) is the external driving force, which you can control in the simulation. This equation shows how the pendulum's acceleration (the second derivative) is determined by the restoring force of gravity (\(\sin(\theta)\)), the frictional damping, and the external driver.
            </p>

            <h2>Applications of Different Driving Forces</h2>
            <p>
                The type of external force, \(F(t)\), dramatically changes the system's behavior. Each forcing function models different real-world scenarios:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sinusoidal:</strong> This is a smooth, continuous force, like a parent gently pushing a child on a swing. It's the most common model for systems with regular, periodic driving, such as AC electrical circuits or the orbital forcing of planetary climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Square Wave:</strong> This represents an abrupt, on-off force. Imagine a motor that switches its thrust direction instantaneously. This models digital electronic signals or mechanical systems with sudden switching actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Pulse Train:</strong> This force delivers short, sharp "kicks" at regular intervals. It's an excellent model for phenomena like the escapement mechanism in a pendulum clock, which gives the pendulum a tiny push on each swing to counteract friction.</li>
                <li><strong>Step Force (Heaviside/Unit Step Function):</strong> This models a force that is suddenly applied at a specific time and then remains constant.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Electrical Circuits:</strong> Flipping a switch to apply a constant voltage to a circuit at \(t=t_0\).</li>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Systems:</strong> Suddenly attaching a weight or abruptly starting a motor to apply a constant force to a spring-mass or pendulum system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Temperature Control:</strong> Turning on a heater that provides constant power at a specific moment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ramp Force:</strong> This represents a force that increases steadily over time.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Loading:</strong> Gradually increasing the weight on a structure, such as by slowly pouring sand onto a platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vehicle Acceleration:</strong> Pressing the accelerator to increase engine torque at a constant rate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fluid Flow:</strong> Opening a valve slowly and linearly, causing the pressure to increase at a constant rate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Impulse Forcing (Dirac Delta Function, \(\delta(t)\)):</strong> An idealized, infinitely strong force applied over an infinitesimally short time. It is used to model sharp, sudden events.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Impact:</strong> Striking a pendulum with a hammer or the collision of two billiard balls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electrical Surge:</strong> A capacitor discharging instantly or a lightning strike causing a sudden current spike in a circuit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shock or Explosion:</strong> A blast wave acting on an object for a very short interval.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
